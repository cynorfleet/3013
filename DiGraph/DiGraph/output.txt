There are 5 verticies in the Graph.
The edges are as follows:
From vertex 0 to:	1	2	3	
From vertex 1 to:	2	4	
From vertex 2 to:	
From vertex 3 to:	2	
From vertex 4 to:	2	

There are 5 verticies in the Graph's complement.
The edges are as follows:
From vertex 0 to:	4	
From vertex 1 to:	0	3	
From vertex 2 to:	0	1	3	4	
From vertex 3 to:	0	1	4	
From vertex 4 to:	0	1	3	

The in-degrees are as follows:
From vertex 0 is:	3
From vertex 1 is:	2
From vertex 2 is:	0
From vertex 3 is:	1
From vertex 4 is:	1

The out-degrees are as follows: 
From vertex 0 is:	0
From vertex 1 is:	1
From vertex 2 is:	4
From vertex 3 is:	1
From vertex 4 is:	1
