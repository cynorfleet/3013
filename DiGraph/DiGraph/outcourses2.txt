There are 10 vertices in the Graph.
The edges are as follows:
From vertex 0 to:	
From vertex 1 to:	7	
From vertex 2 to:	8	
From vertex 3 to:	
From vertex 4 to:	0	
From vertex 5 to:	
From vertex 6 to:	1	2	3	
From vertex 7 to:	4	
From vertex 8 to:	0	9	
From vertex 9 to:	5	6	

There are 10 vertices in the Graph's complement.
The edges are as follows:
From vertex 0 to:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	
From vertex 1 to:	0	2	3	4	5	6	8	9	
From vertex 2 to:	0	1	3	4	5	6	7	9	
From vertex 3 to:	0	1	2	4	5	6	7	8	9	
From vertex 4 to:	0	1	2	3	5	6	7	8	9	
From vertex 5 to:	0	1	2	3	4	6	7	8	9	
From vertex 6 to:	0	3	4	5	7	8	9	
From vertex 7 to:	0	1	2	3	5	6	8	9	
From vertex 8 to:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	
From vertex 9 to:	0	1	2	3	4	5	7	8	


The in-degrees are as follows: 
From vertex 0 is:	2
From vertex 1 is:	1
From vertex 2 is:	1
From vertex 3 is:	1
From vertex 4 is:	1
From vertex 5 is:	1
From vertex 6 is:	1
From vertex 7 is:	1
From vertex 8 is:	1
From vertex 9 is:	1



The out-degrees are as follows:
From vertex 0 is:	0
From vertex 1 is:	1
From vertex 2 is:	1
From vertex 3 is:	0
From vertex 4 is:	1
From vertex 5 is:	0
From vertex 6 is:	3
From vertex 7 is:	1
From vertex 8 is:	2
From vertex 9 is:	2
